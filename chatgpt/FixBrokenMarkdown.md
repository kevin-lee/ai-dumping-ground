# Fix broken Markdown formatting in responses

## 1. Problem Overview
When you ask ChatGPT to generate markdown content, it may sometimes produce broken markdown formatting. This can happen when the response includes code blocks with triple-backticks (```). The following image is an example of such a broken markdown block:

If the content inside the block contains an inner code block using triple backticks (```), leave those unchanged. Do not replace or remove inner fences.
