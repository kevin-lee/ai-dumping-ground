# Fix broken Markdown formatting in responses

## 1. Problem Overview
When you ask ChatGPT to generate Markdown content, it may sometimes produce broken Markdown formatting. This can happen when the response includes code blocks with triple-backticks (<code>```</code>). The following image is an example of such a broken Markdown block:

## 2. Solution
To ensure that the Markdown formatting remains intact, follow these guidelines:

Go to `Settings` -> `Personalization` -> `Custom instructions` in ChatGPT.

### ðŸš¨ Important â€” Copy this into the `What traits should ChatGPT have?` field

> [!IMPORTANT]

> For any copyable Markdown block in your response, wrap it with `~~~` as the outer fence. If the content inside the block contains an inner code block using triple backticks (```), leave those unchanged. Do not replace or remove inner fences. This ensures the outer and inner fences do not conflict, keeping the block fully copyable.
